# Plan 6.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Designed the unified system network via `docker-compose.yml`.

## Actions Taken
- Mapped three critical services into one unified bridge network (`synapse-network`).
- Spun up the `backend` and `hub` leveraging `build` directives, and linked a persistent `ollama_data` volume to the official `ollama/ollama:latest` container to prevent downloading `llama3` every session.
- Exposed the ENV `OLLAMA_HOST` variable to the Python Hub container, natively linking the microservice URL (`http://ollama:11434`) out-of-the-box.

## Verification
- Compose architecture flawlessly orchestrates the distributed project parts.
