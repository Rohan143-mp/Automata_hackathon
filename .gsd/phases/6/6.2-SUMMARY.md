# Plan 6.2 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled identical, agnostic installations of the Python PC Hub regardless of the host OS by packaging required ALSA, PortAudio, and pyttsx3 modules.

## Actions Taken
- Created `hub/Dockerfile` extending `python:3.10-slim`.
- Included native linux commands (`espeak-ng`, `alsa-utils`, `portaudio19-dev`, `python3-pyaudio`) required to render offline TTS and capture audio.
- Exposed all three web serving ports (81 for Glove, 82 for Flutter App, 8765 for Whisper).

## Verification
- Image is built, dependencies map exactly to the phase requirements.
