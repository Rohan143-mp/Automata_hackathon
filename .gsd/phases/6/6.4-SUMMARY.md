# Plan 6.4 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled NVIDIA GPU Passthrough for the Docker Hub and Ollama modules, granting native hardware acceleration to compute-heavy AI components inside isolated containers.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `deploy: resources: reservations: devices` keys to both the `hub` and the `ollama` architecture config in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Enabled the `nvidia` driver explicitly, bypassing CPU limitations.

## Verification
- Docker Compose schema correctly identifies GPU dependencies ahead of execution.
