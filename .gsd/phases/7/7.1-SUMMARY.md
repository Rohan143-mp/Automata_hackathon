# Plan 7.1 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled hot-reload for the PC Hub to eliminate the manual kill-and-restart cycle during development.

## Actions Taken
- Created `hub/dev_server.sh` which runs `watchmedo auto-restart` on all `.py` files in `hub/` and `pc_hub/`.
- Added optional `--debug` flag to launch `debugpy` on port 5678 for VS Code debugger attachment.

## Verification
- Script created and executable. Running `./hub/dev_server.sh` restarts the hub on any file save.
