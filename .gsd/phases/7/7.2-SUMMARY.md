# Plan 7.2 Summary

## Objective Met
Created a standalone glove simulator allowing complete hardware-free testing of the full pipeline.

## Actions Taken
- Created `scripts/simulate_glove.py` with a REPL-based interface.
- Pre-mapped 5 named gestures (`question`, `help`, `yes`, `no`, `repeat`) to specific 7D vectors.
- Added `hr <num>` command to dynamically adjust the simulated heart rate for each packet.

## Verification
- Run `python scripts/simulate_glove.py` → type `question` → Hub should log `[Glove Match]: QUESTION` instantly.
