# Plan 7.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Created a focused REPL for iterating on Ollama prompt engineering without touching the full Hub.

## Actions Taken
- Created `scripts/intent_playground.py` importing `generate_fluent_speech` from the Hub service directly.
- Prompts user for gesture shorthand + optional classroom context.
- Prints the generated Ollama output instantly.
- Provides a sensible default context for rapid testing.

## Verification
- Run `python scripts/intent_playground.py` → enter `question` → Ollama returns a fluent student sentence within seconds.
