# Plan 7.2: `simulate_glove.py` Mock Tool

## Objective
Allow developers to test the full PC Hub Pipeline (matching → Ollama → TTS → Flutter) without any physical hardware attached, by injecting mock 7D vector packets directly into the Hub's WebSocket on port 81.

## Context
- hub/main_server.py (Port 81 ingestion loop)

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create `scripts/simulate_glove.py`</name>
  <files>scripts/simulate_glove.py</files>
  <action>
    - Create a standalone Python script at `scripts/simulate_glove.py`.
    - The script should maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:81`.
    - On each user keystroke / input, format a 7D vector packet as `<F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,GX,GY,HR>` and send it to the Hub.
    - Pre-define named shortcuts: `question` triggers a specific "question" vector, `help` triggers a specific "help" vector, `hr <num>` sets heart rate for the next packet.
    - Include a clear startup banner so the developer knows which gestures are available.
  </action>
  <verify>python scripts/simulate_glove.py</verify>
  <done>Script connects, sends, and the Hub acknowledges the intent match in its output.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Any developer can test the full system without needing physical glove hardware.
