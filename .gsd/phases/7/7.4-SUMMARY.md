# Plan 7.4 Summary

## Objective Met
Instrumented the full pipeline with high-resolution timestamps to expose per-sub-stage latency on every intent cycle.

## Actions Taken
- Wrapped the gesture match → Ollama → TTS → broadcast loop in `hub/main_server.py` with `time.perf_counter()` checkpoints.
- Log line format: `[Latency Probe] Total: Xms | Ollama: Xms | TTS: Xms | Broadcast: Xms`

## Verification
- Trigger a gesture via `simulate_glove.py` while the Hub runs → observe the `[Latency Probe]` log line showing all four sub-stages in ms.
