# Plan 3.2 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled natural translation of matched intents into full sentences using a localized LLM.

## Actions Taken
- Built `hub/services/intent_service.py` pointing to a local `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` Ollama inference server.
- The intent service constructs prompts leveraging a mock Whisper transcript and parses the JSON response.
- Wired this directly into `main_server.py`, converting raw mapped strings to fluent contextual English dynamically.
