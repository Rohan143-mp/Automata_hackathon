# Plan 3.1 Summary

## Objective Met
Established the connection between the PC Hub and the Glove, enabling vector-space matching. 

## Actions Taken
- Created `hub/utils/gesture_library.json` outlining 9 foundational gesture vectors including 'question', 'help', and 'i am miran'. 
- Implemented `hub/services/gesture_engine.py` using `cosine_similarity` to identify intent over 0.95 threshold.
- Began `hub/main_server.py` to continuously ingest on `ws://localhost:81`.
