# Plan 3.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled dynamic syncing of PC Hub AI states back to the Flutter App Dashboard.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `hub/services/app_sync_service.py` to act as a localized WebSocket broadcasting server natively over port 82.
- Wired `broadcast_telemetry(intent, final_speech)` into the bottom of `main_server.py` loop. The moment the Ollama request yields text, a JSON telemetry payload fires to any actively listening Flutter UI.
