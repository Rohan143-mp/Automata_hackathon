# Plan 4.2 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled local, offline synthesized Text-To-Speech from the Hub.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `hub/services/voice_service.py` to expose a simple cross-platform `speak_text(text, speed)` function powered by `pyttsx3`.
- Hooked this synchronous thread locker into `main_server.py` so that it speaks immediately after the inferred Ollama phrase is generated, serving as the biological output climax.

## Verification
- Code successfully isolates the TTS engine and allows parameter modification (speed/rate) ahead of execution.
