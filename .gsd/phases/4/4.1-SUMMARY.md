# Plan 4.1 Summary

## Objective Met
Wired hardware specification for the PAM8403 and Bone Conduction transducer to deliver Bio-Digital Larynx audio outputs safely.

## Actions Taken
- Appended "Audio Output" section to `hardware/wiring_guide.md`.
- Documented connections for the PAM8403 audio in/out pins, emphasizing the need for isolated 5V payload and explicitly requiring a 100uF smoothing capacitor across the amplifier VCC/GND rails to prevent brownouts.

## Verification
- Wiring accurately describes an audio amplification path to the 8Ω bone conduction hardware that avoids power regressions.
