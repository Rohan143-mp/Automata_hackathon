# Plan 4.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Emulated biological emotional intent through variable playback speed.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `hub/services/affective_resonance.py` mapping raw Heart Rate (BPM) values via `calculate_vocal_params(hr)` into a speed scale (`0.85` for <65BPM, `1.30` for >100BPM).
- Updated the pipeline in `main_server.py` to route the incoming CSV Glove Heart Rate into this modifier directly before TTS synthesis.
- Appended the active HR state to the telemetry broadcast so the App Dashboard displays the student's inner state.

## Verification
- Code successfully maps BPM integers to float speed multipliers.
