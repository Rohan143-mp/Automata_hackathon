# Plan 4.1: Bone Conduction Hardware Wiring

## Objective
Update the hardware documentation to include the PAM8403 amplifier and the Bone Conduction transducer. This will allow the student to "feel" the audio generated by the PC Hub.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- hardware/wiring_guide.md

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Document Audio Output Wiring</name>
  <files>hardware/wiring_guide.md</files>
  <action>
    - Append a new section "5. Audio Output (Bone Conduction)" to the end of the guide.
    - Specify that the PAM8403 Class-D Amplifier is powered by the Arduino Nano (5V / GND).
    - Specify that the Audio Input (L/R/GND) will come from a 3.5mm jack connected to the PC Hub (or Bluetooth receiver if untethered). 
    - Detail that the Bone Conduction Transducer (8Ω) connects to the L-out/R-out terminals of the PAM8403.
    - Add a note about placing a 100uF capacitor across the 5V power rails of the PAM8403 to prevent power dip resets on the Nano during loud bass.
  </action>
  <verify>cat hardware/wiring_guide.md</verify>
  <done>wiring_guide.md contains the exact pin and power layout for the PAM8403 and Bone Conduction Transducer.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Hardware wiring guide fully incorporates the Output Array requirements without risking Nano brownouts.
